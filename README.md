# Middleman Prismic


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'middleman-prismic'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install middleman-prismic

## Configuration

To configure the extension, add the following configuration block to Middleman's config.rb:


Parameter     |i Description
----------    |------------
api_url       | the single endpoint of your content repository
access_token  | Prismic API OAuth2 based access token (optional)
release       | The content release (optional, defaults to `master`)
link_resolver | A link resolver. Expects a proc with one param, which is an object of type [Prismic::Fragments::DocumentLink](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/prismicio/ruby-kit/master/Prismic/Fragments/DocumentLink) (optional)

For instance:

```ruby
activate :prismic do |f|
  f.api_url = 'https://testrepositorymiddleman.prismic.io/api'
  f.release = 'master'
  f.link_resolver = ->(link) { binding.pry; "#{link.type.pluralize}/#{link.slug}"}
  f.custom_queries = { test: [Prismic::Predicates::at('document.type', 'product')] }
end
```

## Usage
Run `bundle exec middleman prismic` in your terminal. This will fetch entries for the configured
spaces and content types and put the resulting data in the [local data folder](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/local-data/) as yaml files.

For each document mask you have, you will get a file named `prismic_{document-name}` under `/data`.
So for instance if you have article and product document masks, you will get 2 files: `prismic_articles`, `prismic_products`.
Each file will contain all your documents of the specified document mask in an array.


In your templates, you get for free helper methods named after your document mask that return the Prismic equivelant object.
For instance for articles, if you run `<%= articles %>` you get back a `Prismic::Document`.

If at any time need access to `Prismic::Ref` you can do it using the `reference` helper.

## Prismic Preview

Prismic supports a preview function by sending a browser to `/preview`
with a `token` and `document_id` on the query. This middleware is intended
to hook into Middleman to add a `/preview` endpoint that will fetch the
preview content by token (as `ref`) and display the content in the Middleman
server.

In your Middleman app, add the following to `config.rb` to activate
this middleware:

```ruby
require "middleman-prismic/preview"

use Middleman::Prismic::Preview
```

Now when running the `middleman` server, any requests to `/preview` will be
intercepted. The `token` param will be read and used to execute
`middleman prismic --ref ${token}`. Because Middleman is running as a
server, when the content from Prismic is downloaded, it will show the
live content when browsing the Middleman site.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
